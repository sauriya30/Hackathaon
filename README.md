INSPIRATION 

My team and I are huge sports enthusiasts and love to catch up and play and watch sports together, due to this interest and our computer science background we thought about creating a machine learning model to apply it to something we love . The Indian Super League is a relativley unknown league in the broad spectrum of the footballing world and we identified a research gap in this League. We wanted to create a model to predict the winner of this league with its unique pattern of quaifification


WHAT IT DOES

This an attempt to create  machine learning model to predict the winner of an Indian Super League(Football).
The models used are Linear regression model and KNN algorithm.
The database is composed of information about past matches, player and team performance metrics.
The proposed system uses machine learning techniques that uses data to generate predictions for future matches. The system will use supervised learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and make accurate predictions. Additionally, unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to detect patterns in the data that can be used to predict labels.

HOW I BUILT IT


Data preprocessing: Start by cleaning and preparing your data. This might include removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical values if needed.

Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones that could help improve the predictive power of your model. This could include things like the teams' past performance, the number of goals scored or conceded, and the player stats.

Model selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm to train our model. Some common algorithms for classification problems include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM).

Model training and evaluation: Split our data into training and testing sets, and use the training set to fit your model. Evaluate the performance of our model on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Model optimization: Fine-tune the model to achieve better performance. This could involve adjusting hyperparameters, using different feature selection techniques, or trying different algorithms.

Prediction:  We use our trained model to predict the winner of future Indian Super League matches.

The used KNN algorithm gave an accuracy of 66%, but we aim to increase the accuracy by increasing the sample size.
