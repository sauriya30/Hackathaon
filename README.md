This an attempt to create  machine learning model to predict the winner of an Indian Super League(Football).
The models used are Linear regression model and KNN algorithm.
The database is composed of information about past matches, player and team performance metrics.
The proposed system uses machine learning techniques that uses data to generate predictions for future matches. The system will use supervised learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and make accurate predictions. Additionally, unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to detect patterns in the data that can be used to predict labels.
The used KNN algorithm gave an accuracy of 66%, but we aim to increase the accuracy by increasing the sample size.
