This an attempt to create  machine learning model to predict a tournament winner using linear regression model and using a custom made database 
The proposed system is a machine learning system that uses data from past matches, player and team performance metrics, and other information to generate predictions for future matches. The system will use supervised learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and make accurate predictions. Additionally, unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to detect patterns in the data that can be used to predict labels.
